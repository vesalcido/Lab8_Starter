### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
I think the way graceful degradation and service workers are related is that both help websites work even when something goes wrong,like when there’s no internet. Graceful degradation means a website is built to still function in a basic way if some features can’t load. Service workers help with this by saving important files like HTML, CSS, and data so they can be used offline. That way, even if you're not connected to the internet, the website can still show something useful instead of just breaking.
